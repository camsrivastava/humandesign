A polymerase-chain-reaction assay of the specimen was performed, and the species was identified as Leishmania panamensis. Treatment with oral miltefosine (at a dose of 50 mg three times daily for 28 days) was initiated. Cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. panamensis can disseminate to the oronasopharyngeal mucosa. A fiberoptic examination of the nasopharynx performed 6 days after the patient began treatment showed no evidence of mucosal disease. Ten days after the completion of therapy, the ulcer had healed with an atrophic scar, and the number and size of the subcutaneous nodules were markedly reduced.\n\n",

Upper endoscopy revealed the following image after food impaction was removed. This finding is associated with what underlying diagnosis?Q:Eosinophilic esophagitis\n\nUpper endoscopy revealed prominent mucosal rings extending 20 cm from the incisors to the level of the gastroesophageal junction, with two discrete areas of narrowing and associated linear furrows. Biopsy specimens were obtained, and esophagitis was observed, with more than 40 eosinophils per high-power field. An endoscopic finding of fixed esophageal rings, or \"trachealization,\" is suggestive of eosinophilic esophagitis, although a definitive diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical presentation, histologic findings, and the exclusion of other causes of esophageal eosinophilia, such as proton-pump inhibitor-responsive esophageal eosinophilia. The patient was treated with an 8-week course of omeprazole, but there was no symptom resolution or histologic improvement on repeat endoscopic biopsies, which confirmed the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis. \n\n",

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common risk factor for squamous-cell carcinoma of the penis, as is the case here. HPV can also cause cervical cancer in women. The presence of metastasis to the inguinal lymph nodes is a poor prognostic factor for survival.

Taenia saginata, also known as beef tapeworm, is a parasitic infection. The eggs of Taenia saginata in infected feces are deposited in soil and contaminate vegetation. When cattle ingest contaminated vegetation, the eggs hatch and release oncospheres that migrate into muscles of the cows, where they become cysticerci. When people eat undercooked or raw beef that is infected, cysticerci develop into tapeworm in the intestine.\n\n",

However, the procedure is associated with a number of complications. Overlapping or excessively central incisions may lead to reduced visual acuity, and corneal scarring is associated with glare and halos. Patients are at risk for progressive hyperopia and, in rare cases, due to reduced corneal biomechanical strength, globe rupture with minimal trauma.\n\n",

It is a gram-negative spirochete that causes syphilis, which is classified into primary, secondary, or tertiary stages of infections that are defined by clinical presentations. Primary syphilis typically presents with painless ulcers, often in the genitalia and usually within the first 3 months of infection.  Secondary syphilis usually occurs within 2 months after the resolution of the ulcers and can manifest with nonspecific clinical features such as pharyngitis, fever, and mucocutaneous lesions. Tertiary syphilis typically presents years to decades after the initial infection and commonly manifests with cardiac, neurological, and dermatological features.\n\n",

On examination of the left lower leg, an edematous erythematous plaque was pulsating with alternating erythema and blanching in synchrony with his pulse. What is the most likely diagnosis?Q:Insect bite\n\nQuincke\u2019s sign is an alternating blanching and flushing of a specific site, in rhythm with arterial pulsation. This sign typically refers to capillary pulsations seen in the fingernail bed that are associated with aortic insufficiency. However, this sign can also be seen in other focal areas due to an insect bite. It is thought that the localized vasodilatation and edema present at the site of the insect bite causes arterioles to be unable to maintain adequate pressure during diastole, resulting in this pulsating blanching and flushing phenomenon.\n\n",

On physical examination, his abdomen was diffusely tender, and he had hyperpigmented macules on the lips, oral mucosa, and nose. What is the most likely underlying diagnosis?Q:Peutz\u2013Jeghers syndrome \n\nA computed tomographic scan of the patient\u2019s abdomen showed a target sign, which is characteristic of intussusception. Emergency laparotomy confirmed the presence of jejunojejunal intussusception with areas of necrosis. Multiple polyps were palpated throughout this section of the bowel. Because of the necrosis and concern about recurrence, the length of jejunum that contained polyps was resected, and end-to-end anastomosis was performed. Histopathological evaluation of the resected segment revealed multiple hamartomatous polyps. His two sons had previously presented with abdominal pain due to intussusception and had undergone bowel resection. On the basis of the mucocutaneous hyperpigmentation, multiple hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract, and family history, a diagnosis of the Peutz\u2013Jeghers syndrome was made. This autosomal dominant disorder is associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal cancers.\n\n",

Acute schistosomiasis syndrome, also known as Katayama fever, is thought to be due to a hypersensitivity reaction to schistosomal antigens present during schistosomal infection. The onset of symptoms coincides with the production of schistosomal eggs, when the antigen burden is particularly high. Symptoms typically manifest as fever, cough, urticarial rash, and fatigue. Eosinophilia is a common finding on labs, and transient pulmonary infiltrates are often seen on chest x-ray films.  \n\n",

Persistent pupillary membranesQ:Answer:Image ChallengeA 15-year-old boy presented with decreased vision in both eyes, and a slit lamp examination revealed this finding. What is the diagnosis?Q:Persistent pupillary membranes\n\nThe correct answer is persistent pupillary membranes (PPMs). PPMs represent remnants of the tunica vasculosa lentis, which is the blood supply for the developing lens of the fetus. Remnants of the capillaries may persist as small strands attached to the collarette of the iris. Vision is usually unaffected, but occasionally thick, persistent pupillary membranes can cause deprivational amblyopia.\n\n",

Intra-oral examination showed discoloration of the right lateral mandibular incisor (right). What is the most likely diagnosis?Q:Odontogenic cutaneous fistula\n\nThe answer is odontogenic cutaneous fistula. Odontogenic cutaneous fistula is caused by chronic infection of the tooth root due to dental caries, periodontal disease, or tooth fracture, as was likely to have occurred in this case. The condition manifests as dimpling, a nodule or cyst on the chin, jaw or elsewhere on the face. Misdiagnosis may occur due to the variable appearance and possible lack of dental symptoms.  \n\n",

GCA is a medium- and large-vessel vasculitis. Clinical presentation includes constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Permanent visual loss is a horrific complication of GCA and is commonly due to the occlusion of the posterior ciliary artery which is a branch of the ophthalmic artery from the internal carotid artery. Symptoms of headache and jaw claudication are due to the involvement of the branches of the external carotid artery.  Due to the extensive collateral circulation in the scalp area, scalp necrosis is uncommon but can occur in GCA, as is the case here.\n\n",

SyphilisQ:Answer:Image ChallengeThese oral ulcers were painless. What is the most likely diagnosis?Q:Syphilis\n\nThe ulcers have clean, smooth bases and slightly elevated, indurated borders. This type of painless ulcer is typical of a syphilitic chancre. The patient reported having had unprotected orogenital sex with his girlfriend about 2 weeks before the onset of the ulcers. Rapid plasma reagin testing was positive with a titer of at least 1:32. In addition, a Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay was strongly positive, and a fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test was positive for both IgG and IgM antibodies. The patient's girlfriend also had positive results on serologic analyses for syphilis, and both were treated successfully with intramuscular penicillin. Chancroid and herpetic ulcers tend to be painful. Cancers do not typically involve both upper and lower lips simultaneously.\n\n",

The patient presented within hours after a coronary angiogram and was pretreated with hydrocortisone and diphenhydramine before the procedure for similar symptoms. Iodide-associated sialadenitis is rare and can result from an elevated concentration of iodine in the saliva, which causes swelling of the mucosal duct and impaired salivary excretion. The risk of sialadenitis may be increased with impaired renal function owing to impaired clearance of iodinated contrast material.\n\n",

Left anterior descending artery occlusionQ:Answer:Image ChallengeWhat is the most likely diagnosis in a man with chest pain, hypotension, dizziness, and this ECG finding?Q:Right coronary artery occlusion\n\nRight coronary artery occlusion is the correct answer. The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF, and V1, which is concerning for inferior wall and right ventricle involvement. Right ventricular infarction should be suspected when ST-segment elevation is seen in leads V1-V2, and an ECG with right-sided precordial leads should be performed. The right ventricle and the inferior wall of the heart are typically supplied by the right coronary artery.\n\n",

Physical examination was notable for a temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius and a grade 3/6 diastolic murmur throughout the precordium. Laboratory studies revealed a white-cell count of 18,000 per cubic millimeter. CT angiography of the right arm revealed an aneurysm of the ulnar artery.  What is the diagnosis?Q:Infective endocarditis\n\nThe correct answer is infective endocarditis.  Infective endocarditis refers to an infection of the endocardial surface of the heart. It can present with constitutional complaints including, fatigue, weight loss, myalgia, and fever. Peripheral mycotic aneurysms are rare complications of infective endocarditis that require surgical intervention for treatment.\n\n",

Polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing of samples obtained from the infant\u2019s skin, conjunctivae, pharynx, and blood were positive for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and a diagnosis of neonatal HSV-1 infection that was confined to the skin, eyes, and mucosa was made. The mother reported no history of previous HSV-1 infection. However, a postpartum endocervical PCR assay was positive for HSV-1. In this case, a primary maternal infection late in pregnancy was thought to have led to ascending intrauterine infection and possibly preterm labor after prolonged rupture of membranes. Treatment with acyclovir was given. At 2 years of age, the child had had no recurrences and was developmentally normal.\r\n\n\n",

In certain cases, pneumatosis intestinalis may be considered a surrogate marker for intestinal ischemia and impending perforation. However, the condition may also occur in a benign context and is no longer considered a disease but rather a sign, and its significance needs to be considered in accordance with each patient's clinical context.\n\n",

Slit-lamp examination of the left eye revealed a deformed iris with the upper portion sagging downward, detached from the 9 o\u2019clock position to the 3 o\u2019clock position. The patient noted symptoms starting after he was struck in the eye by a retracting rubber bungee cord that he was using to secure goods onto a motorcycle. Separation of the iris from the ciliary body caused by blunt injury, known as traumatic iridodialysis, can lead to blurred vision, monocular double vision, or photophobia. \n\n",

Metronidazole-associated encephalopathyQ:Answer:Image ChallengeWhat is the most likely diagnosis in a patient with dysarthria and gait instability and this finding?Q:Metronidazole-associated encephalopathy\n\nMetronidazole-associated encephalopathy is the correct answer. It is a rare complication associated with the drug metronidazole, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain typically reveals a symmetric, enhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal in the dentate nuclei of the cerebellum. Symptoms of ataxia, dizziness, and dysarthria have been reported. \n\n",

Examination was notable for bluish discoloration of the sclera of both eyes and pinnae of both ears. Ophthalmologic examination was otherwise normal. What is the diagnosis?Q:Minocycline-induced pigmentation\n\nThe correct answer is minocycline-induced pigmentation. Prolonged treatment with minocycline can cause blue-gray pigmentation of the skin, sclerae, pinnae, fingernails, teeth, gums, and scar tissue. A proposed mechanism for this pigmentation is that metabolites of minocycline form insoluble complexes with melanin or iron that can deposit in body tissues, particularly in tissues that are exposed to light. The staining may resolve slowly, or it can be permanent.\n\n",

Laboratory studies were notable for absolute eosinophilia. A skin biopsy of the left arm was performed, and histopathological examination showed a perivascular and interstitial inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes and eosinophils in the deep reticular dermis and subcutis. The patient was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone, oral mycophenolate mofetil, and intravenous immune globulin.\n\n",

The non-contrast CT of the head shows a thickened calvaria with perpendicular proliferation of the trabeculae, a finding termed the hair-on-end sign. These skull changes are a result of red marrow proliferation leading to alternating thickened and opaque trabeculae with radiolucent marrow hyperplasia. This finding can be seen in the context of hemolytic anemias, such as sickle cell disease, thalassemia major, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.  \n\n",

What is the most likely diagnosis?Q:Malignant syphilis\n\nThe correct answer is malignant syphilis. A Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay was also positive. Malignant syphilis is an uncommon form of secondary syphilis that primarily affects immunocompromised persons. The skin manifestations are varied, ranging from ulceronodular lesions to oyster shell-like crusts, as seen in this patient. After a 2-week course of intravenous antimicrobial therapy, the skin lesions and fevers abated. \n\n",

What is the diagnosis?Q:Silicone oil hyperoleon  \n\nSlit-lamp examination of the right eye revealed a layer of emulsified silicone oil in the superior anterior chamber, known as a hyperoleon, that moved slightly with tilting of the head. The long-term use of silicone oil as an endotamponade in ocular surgery can result in complications associated with emulsification of silicone oil and prolapse through anatomically compromised areas. The density of silicone oil is lower than that of aqueous humor, and therefore, it settles at the top of the anterior chamber. The silicone oil was surgically removed, and the patient\u2019s visual acuity improved to 20/80.\n\n",

The skin lesions began as small purpuric lesions on the patient's legs that spread to his face, abdomen, and limbs. The diagnosis in this case is acute infectious purpura fulminans in the setting of his bacteremia, but purpura fulminans can also be idiopathic or associated with hereditary protein C and S deficiencies. The purpura evolved as the patient developed septic shock; as his condition was treated and clinically improved, the lesions initially developed bullae with recessed centers then ulcerated, followed by the development of granulation tissue, and, ultimately, healing.\n\n",

What is the best next step in regard to the right lung opacity?Q:Diurese the patient and then obtain a repeat chest radiograph\n\nThe correct answer is diurese the patient and then obtain a repeat chest radiograph. The chest radiograph showed signs of volume overload as well as a sharply demarcated, lenticular opacity in the right middle lung field. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 45% and severe mitral regurgitation. After 3 days of diuresis and vasodilator therapy, a follow-up chest radiograph showed complete resolution of the right lung opacity, as well as reduced pulmonary edema. A diagnosis of phantom tumor \u2014 also known as vanishing tumor or pseudotumor \u2014 was made.

What is the likely diagnosis?Q:Lymphangioleiomyomatosis\n\nThe correct answer is lymphangioleiomyomatosis. This is a rare condition that typically affects women in their 30s to mid-40s. It is caused by activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling pathway (mTOR) leading to lymphangiogenesis and formation of numerous thin-walled cysts lined with spindle cells co-expressing smooth muscle and melanocytic markers. Recurrent pneumothorax is common. Therapy with sirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, can reduce symptoms. \n\n",

The electrocardiogram shows peaked T waves and a prolonged QT segment. Hypocalcemia can be seen after parathyroidectomy as a result of \u201chungry bone syndrome.\u201d It is thought that the acute withdrawal of parathyroid hormone after surgery results in an imbalance of calcium homeostasis resulting in hypocalcemia and other electrolyte abnormalities. The QT interval is increased due to the prolongation of ventricular action potential and ST segment from hypocalcemia.\n\n",

Q:Tissue plasminogen activator-associated angioedema\n\nOrolingual angioedema is a known potential adverse effect of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). The swelling can be asymmetric at first and can develop in a location contralateral to the ischemic lesion following a stroke. The mechanism is incompletely understood. Treatment in this case included intravenous antihistamines and glucocorticoids, without need for advanced airway management. The tongue swelling resolved, but at a follow-up visit 3 months after presentation, some neurologic deficits resulting from the stroke remained.\n\n",

This syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder that is caused by a mutation in the multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) gene resulting in deficient canalicular expression of MRP2. It leads to impaired secretion of conjugated bilirubin into the bile. Prothrombin time and liver enzyme levels are typically normal. \n\n",

The capillary network of hair follicles preserves melanogenesis and maintains pigmentation. A skin biopsy demonstrated hyalinized collagen in the dermis consistent with scleroderma.\n\n",

What is the most likely causative organism?Q:Corynebacterium minutissimum\n\nCorynebacterium minutissimum grew on a bacterial culture of skin scrapings and a diagnosis of inguinal erythrasma was made. Erythrasma is a superficial bacterial skin infection caused by C. minutissimum. It typically manifests in the intertriginous or interdigital areas. It may be mistaken for a superficial fungal skin infection, but it can be differentiated from a dermatophytosis by its reddish-brown color and minimal scaling. A Wood\u2019s lamp examination facilitates diagnosis owing to the characteristic coral-red fluorescence, which is caused by porphyrins produced by the bacteria. \n\n",

Staphylococcal pyodermaQ:Answer:Image ChallengeWhat is the diagnosis?Q:Harlequin color change\n\nHarlequin color change is a dramatic but benign phenomenon in which the color on the dependent half of an infant turns deep red while the upper half is pale. Usually, this benign change in color is abrupt, lasts between 30 seconds and 20 minutes, and resolves with increased activity. Up to 10% of infants undergo this color change, which occurs between the second and fifth days of life. Attributed to a temporary imbalance in autonomic regulation, the phenomenon is more common among low-birth-weight infants. \n\n",

Findings on immunohistochemical analysis identified human papillomavirus as the etiologic agent. It is uncommon for tonsillar cancer to present as a visible lesion, as in this case, as tumors may be hidden within the tonsillar crypts.\n\n",

Although the cause of lichen planus has not been established definitively, it is thought to be an autoimmune disease. Findings of hyperkeratosis, wedge-shaped hypergranulosis, sawtooth rete pegs, and bandlike lymphocytic inflammation on skin biopsy (as in this case) are confirmatory of diagnosis. Topical or intralesional glucocorticoids may be used in primary treatment, with ultraviolet light therapy and oral immunosuppressive agents reserved for more extensive cases.\n\n",

What is the most likely diagnosis?Q:Takayasu\u2019s arteritis\n\nThe correct diagnosis is Takayasu\u2019s arteritis. The three-dimensional CT reconstruction shown here demonstrates a completely disrupted abdominal aorta, severe stenosis of the bilateral renal arteries, and development of numerous collateral arteries. Given this pattern of vascular involvement, a large-vessel vasculitis, Takayasu\u2019s arteritis, is the most likely diagnosis. The development of collateral arteries suggests a chronic process. Takayasu\u2019s arteritis is also known as pulseless disease and is most commonly seen in young Asian women. It primarily affects the aorta and its major branches, including the renal arteries, which can cause renal artery stenosis and uncontrolled hypertension.\n\n",

With what underlying disease process is this form of anemia most closely associated?Q:Decompensated cirrhosis\n\nThe answer is decompensated cirrhosis. Spur-cell anemia is a form of hemolytic anemia that can occur in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Acanthocytes acquire spiny projections on their surfaces as a result of altered lipid metabolism and an excess of cholesterol in patients with cirrhosis; these changes make the erythrocytes inflexible and prone to haemolysis. Acanthocytes are often confused with echinocytes (burr cells), which have more regularly spaced spicules. \n\n",

Initial computed tomography revealed a large left frontotemporal mass with areas of calcification. MRI re-demonstrated a 3.8 x 6.2 x 3.9 cm mass; absence of contrast enhancement or intraluminal filling raised suspicion of a thrombosed aneurysm. The thrombosed aneurysm is likely to have originated from the bifurcation of the middle cerebral artery.

These physical exam findings are associated with what underlying condition?\r\nQ:Vitamin A deficiency \n\nThe ocular findings were consistent with Bitot\u2019s spots, which are accumulations of keratin, often intermixed with an overgrowth of Corynebacterium xerosis, that result from epithelial metaplasia caused by vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency can also cause blindness, as a result of corneal ulceration with scarring, and particularly night blindness, as a result of dysfunction of rod photoreceptor cells. In this patient, the serum vitamin A level was 16.8 \u03bcg per deciliter (0.59 \u03bcmol per liter) (reference range, 20 to 40 \u03bcg per deciliter [0.70 to 1.40 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the retinol-binding protein level was 0.01 g per liter (reference range, 0.03 to 0.06). Further history taking revealed extreme poverty, and further examination showed signs of dietary deficiency, with no evidence of intestinal parasites. The patient received an oral dose of vitamin A, which was repeated 4 weeks later. Artificial tears were also administered. The Bitot\u2019s spots abated, although they did not completely resolve, over the course of 12 weeks. The parents were advised to administer another dose of vitamin A every 6 months until the child was 5 years of age.\n\n",

This patient\u2019s stone composition was 80% calcium phosphate and 20% struvite. Risk factors for calcium phosphate crystal formation include high urine pH. The use of intestinal segments to create urinary diversions can lead to stone disease as a result of persistent bicarbonate loss in the urine, hyperoxaluria, and long-term colonization of urea-splitting bacteria in the urinary tract. Additional risks for stone formation in a continent urinary reservoir include urinary stasis, mucus production, and nonabsorbable surgical materials used to construct the substitute bladder.\n\n",

Pellucid marginal degeneration Q:Answer:Image ChallengeA 53-year-old man who had been admitted to the hospital after a fall was noted to have an abnormal indentation of the lower eyelids. He had a history of corneal transplantation in both eyes. He had recently experienced progressive visual impairment, which had led to his fall. Ophthalmologic examination was notable for a deflection of the lower eyelids when he was looking down, owing to dome-shaped eyes, and decreased visual acuity. What is the most likely diagnosis?\r\nQ:Keratoconus\n\nThe correct answer is keratoconus. Keratoconus is a noninflammatory disorder characterized by corneal thinning and bulging outward in a cone shape. Downward deflection of the eyelid on downward gaze, or Munson\u2019s Sign, may be seen in severe cases. Given the advanced nature of his disease, this patient was referred to ophthalmology for repeat corneal transplantation. \n\n",

In this case, chest radiographs obtained during inspiration and expiration showed a lack of diaphragmatic movement on both sides. Spirometry also identified a decrease in forced vital capacity of more than 50% when the patient moved from an upright position to a supine position. Underlying causes of diaphragm paralysis include processes that affect the nervous system, the muscle itself, or the neuromuscular junction. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine for this patient showed canal stenosis from C3 to C6 with associated myelomalacia.

Testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae by PCR of the nasopharyngeal aspirate and for serum IgM antibody was positive. Mycoplasma is commonly associated with exanthems. In this case, the clinical presentation was consistent with Mycoplasma pneumoniae-induced erythema multiforme, also referred to as mycoplasma-induced rash and mucositis. Given the severity of the mucosal involvement, a nasogastric tube was placed for nutrition and for administration of medications.

Crohn's disease does not cause large abscesses, and the chronicity would not suggest a pancreatic pseudocyst. Malrotation would not explain the multicystic mass.

Voriconazole is a trifluorinated antifungal medication; the mechanism of the periostitis is thought to be related to the effects of fluoride on bone. Voriconazole was discontinued in the patient, and after consultation with the transplantation team, no further antifungal prophylaxis was initiated. At a 7-month follow-up visit, the pain had decreased, although limitations in range of motion and bony swelling of the hands persisted.\r\n\n\n",

Bilateral vestibular schwannomas are a hallmark of neurofibromatosis type 2. In affected persons, there may be development of schwannomas on other cranial and peripheral nerves, meningiomas, ependymomas, and astrocytomas. Patients may have a parent affected with neurofibromatosis type 2, which is caused by mutations in NF2. These abnormalities are inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner, although de novo mutations may also occur.\n\n",

Tetracycline Q:Answer:Image ChallengeA 42-year-old man who was undergoing treatment for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma presented to the oncology clinic with changes in his fingernails. Five months earlier, he had presented with gastric-outlet obstruction and had received a diagnosis of high-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. What is the most likely underlying cause of this presentation?Q:Chemotherapy\n\nThe correct answer is chemotherapy. This patient completed four cycles of chemotherapy, which had included rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin prior to this finding on physical examination. The opaque-appearing transverse lines (long arrow) on the fingernails are called Mees\u2019 lines (true leukonychia), and the more translucent-appearing lines (short arrow) are called Muehrcke\u2019s lines (apparent leukonychia). Mees\u2019 lines develop as a result of injury to the nail matrix, whereas Muehrcke\u2019s lines are related to abnormal nailbed vasculature. Therefore, Mees\u2019 lines do not diminish with compression of the nail plate, and Muehrcke\u2019s lines do. Multiple chemotherapy agents are associated with these nail changes. Muehrcke\u2019s lines can also occur in patients with hypoalbuminemia. After six cycles of chemotherapy, the patient had remission of the non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Approximately 6 months after the completion of chemotherapy, the fingernail changes resolved completely.\n\n",

Ten days before presentation, a fever and cough had developed. She had no history of medication use. Physical examination was notable for conjunctivitis in both eyes and ulcers in the oropharynx. There were scattered vesicular lesions across her face, and her swollen, bleeding, exudative lips made it difficult for her to open her mouth (left). Targetoid lesions with vesicles were scattered across her arms and legs (right), and multiple small ulcers were found in the vulvar and perianal regions. Rales were present in both lung bases. Imaging of the chest showed infiltrates in both lungs. What is the most appropriate next step?Q:Testing for bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens\n\nA serum IgM antibody test and a sputum polymerase-chain-reaction test were positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. A diagnosis of mycoplasma-induced rash and mucositis was made. Although this postinfection mucocutaneous syndrome may manifest in a way similar to the Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome, the prognosis is more favorable. Supportive care was administered, and treatment with doxycycline was given for the pneumonia. Two weeks later, lesions had abated, and the pneumonia symptoms resolved soon after.\n\n",

The differential diagnosis is broad and the diagnostic approach depends on the history and exam findings. Venous disease is the most common cause of lower-extremity ulcers. Irregularity of shape and color, change in size, and symptoms of inflammation should prompt suspicion for malignancy, as is the case here.

Physical examination of the abdomen was normal, but he was noted to have gray lines along the margins of his lower gum. What is the most likely diagnosis?Q:Lead poisoning\n\nThe correct answer is lead poisoning. The gray lines on the gums are Burton\u2019s line, which is a sign of chronic lead intoxication that develops when lead reacts with oral bacteria metabolites. The patient had a 10-year history of chewing opium. Lead is sometimes added to opium to increase its weight when sold. The patient was treated with chelating agents and counseled to stop chewing opium. At his 7 month follow-up, he had resolution of his symptoms, and Burton\u2019s line had diminished.\n\n",

Quadriceps tendon rupture is a rare condition, but it may occur spontaneously or with minimal trauma in patients with chronic kidney disease and secondary hyperparathyroidism. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of rupture are not well understood. Initial laboratory testing for this patient indicated untreated secondary hyperparathyroidism, for which calcitriol was initiated. \n\n",

What is the diagnosis?Q:Myasthenia gravis\n\nThe correct answer is Myasthenia gravis. An ice pack was placed over the left eye and after 2 minutes, the ptosis had improved. The inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity at a reduced muscle temperature is thought to underlie the improvement. The ice-pack test is a useful bedside test to distinguish myasthenia gravis from other causes of ptosis or ophthalmoparesis. The diagnosis was supported by the presence of serum anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies and electrodiagnostic testing, which showed a decremental response to repetitive nerve stimulation. \n\n",

It is classified by the site of occlusion (branched vs. central) and by categories of perfusion (ischemic or nonischemic). Retinal vein occlusion can lead to hyperemia and swelling of the optic nerve, macular edema, retinal hemorrhage, and tortuous and dilated veins. The evaluation of a sudden painless vision loss needs to consider occlusion of the retinal artery or vein, retinal detachment, occipital stroke, and vitreous hemorrhage.

Though this patient had isolated kidney involvement, anti-GBM disease can involve both the kidneys and lungs. Radiography or computerized tomography of the chest is needed to assess for pulmonary involvement in anti-GBM disease.

Pupils that are nonreactive to bright light but briskly constrict when focusing on a near object are known as Argyll Robertson pupils, which are characteristic of tabes dorsalis. Tabes dorsalis is a form of neurosyphilis that is characterized by degeneration of the nerves in the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, which leads to ataxia and loss of proprioception, as well as this pupil finding.

This cast was produced by a 36-year-old man who was admitted to the intensive care unit with an acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure. His medical history included heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, bioprosthetic aortic-valve replacement for bicuspid aortic stenosis, endovascular stenting of an aortic aneurysm, and placement of a permanent pacemaker for complete heart block. An Impella ventricular assist device was placed for management of acute heart failure, and a continuous heparin infusion was initiated for systemic anticoagulation. During the next week, the patient had episodes of small-volume hemoptysis and increasing respiratory distress. During an extreme bout of coughing, the patient spontaneously expectorated an intact cast of the right bronchial tree. The right bronchial tree consists of three segmental branches in the upper lobe (blue arrows), two segmental branches in the middle lobe (white arrows), and five segmental branches in the lower lobe (black arrows). \n\n",

Restrictive Cardiomyopathy Q:Answer:Image ChallengeA 69-year-old woman with a history of asbestos exposure presented to the emergency department with a 3-year history of dyspnea on exertion. Physical examination showed signs of volume overload. A chest radiograph showed circumferential calcification of the pericardium and pleural effusions. Simultaneous left and right heart catheterization showed ventricular interdependence and discordance of the pressure tracings (right ventricular pressure, solid arrow; left ventricular pressure, dotted arrow). What is the diagnosis? Q:Constrictive Pericarditis\n\nThe correct answer is constrictive pericarditis, in this case owing to asbestosis. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a preserved ejection fraction with a septal bounce in early diastole as well as expiratory diastolic reversal in the hepatic vein. The simultaneous left and right heart catheterization tracing was characteristic of constrictive pericarditis. During inspiration, when pressures in the right ventricle were at their highest, left ventricular pressures were at their lowest; this pattern reversed during expiration. A \u201csquare root\u201d sign (also called a dip-and-plateau pattern; red line), which represents rapid ventricular filling in early diastole before abrupt cessation in late diastole, was also seen.\n\n",

The image shows scrotal lymphatic filariasis, a parasitic infection caused by mosquito-transmitted nematodes. The mobile echogenic structures represent the live worms that had migrated into the lymphatic channels. The diagnosis was confirmed when light microscopy of the scrotal aspirate identified Wuchereria bancrofti. After a 3-week course of oral diethylcarbamazine, the patient\u2019s symptoms abated, and a second ultrasound showed no evidence of the motile microfilariae. \n\n",

Its diagnosis is often delayed or missed due to the atypical clinical presentation. The involvement of the nail bed can lead to dystrophic nails, leading to onycholysis and secondary infections masking the presence of the tumor. Involvement of the digits of the hands occurs more frequently than those of the feet.

Brown recluse spider biteQ:Answer:Image ChallengeWhich of the following is the least likely cause of eschars as seen here?Q:Chickenpox\n\nChickenpox is the least likely to cause eschars. Eschars can be caused by a number of rickettsial diseases. They can also be due to cutaneous anthrax, bites from the brown recluse spider, and from scrub typhus.  The images here show the evolution of a torn bulla over time from a miteborne disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, also known as scrub typhus. Acute scrub typhus typically presents with fever and maculopapular rash with a primary lesion that evolves. Over time, the center of the eschar developed a black crust covering the ulcer, which was surrounded by an erythematous rim. \n\n",

Clinical features include fever, nonexudative conjunctivitis in both eyes, mucositis, cervical lymphadenopathy, polymorphous rash, and changes in the hands and feet. Because not all these features are necessarily present and there is no specific diagnostic test for Kawasaki\u2019s disease, the diagnosis may be missed in childhood or occur at such an early age that the adult patient has no recollection of illness. Affected children are at risk for cardiovascular complications. This patient had a history of Kawasaki\u2019s disease, which had been diagnosed when he was 11 years of age. Despite treatment with intravenous immune globulin, coronary artery aneurysms were detected on imaging (the left panel shows a coronary angiogram obtained 3 years before the current presentation). Emergency coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the left anterior descending artery.\n\n",

    "question": "A previously healthy 44-year-old woman presented to the oral medicine clinic with an 11-month history of mouth ulcers and blistered lips. The lesions had caused pain while eating, with resultant unintentional weight loss. She also reported a 6-month history of skin blisters on her arms and legs. On physical examination, the lips were swollen with bleeding erosions and yellow pustules. Erosions were seen on the hard palate, as well as on the floor of the mouth, tongue, and buccal mucosa. Gingivitis and halitosis were also present. Flaccid bullae and blisters were seen on the skin of the arms and legs. Biopsy of the gingiva revealed intraepithelial separation and retention of basal cells along the basement membrane. Direct immunofluorescence of the biopsy specimen showed IgG deposition along epithelial-cell membranes, resulting in a \u201cchicken wire\u201d pattern. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "question": "A 79-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of hematemesis, melena, and epigastric pain. Approximately 1 day before the onset of symptoms, nonbloody vomiting had developed after she had eaten unrefrigerated food. She was taking aspirin daily for coronary artery disease. Her heart rate was 102 beats per minute, and her blood pressure was 89/66 mmHg. Physical examination was notable for pallor and diaphoresis. Her hemoglobin level was 9.1 g per deciliter (reference range, 11 to 15), a decrease from a baseline level of 12 g per deciliter 6 months previously. Computed tomography of the chest was performed to evaluate for esophageal rupture and showed only a mucosal tear and soft-tissue swelling at the gastroesophageal junction. An upper endoscopy was performed. A diagnosis of Mallory-Weiss syndrome was made. Which of the following would be the LEAST appropriate next step in management for this diagnosis?",
